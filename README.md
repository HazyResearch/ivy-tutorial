# ivy-tutorial


This tutorial describes how to use Ivy to synthesize an instrumental variable (IV) from a set of IV candidates that are potentially dependent on each other and invalid. The synthesized IV can then be used for downstream causal inference. The code is run on Python 3. 

## How to run
  - Install dependencies using the following command:
  ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  - Open and run ivy-intro-tutorial.ipynb
